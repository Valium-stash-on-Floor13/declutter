          <h1 className="text-[#333333] font-bold text-3xl mb-[10px]">Dispose of e-waste properly!</h1>
          <p className="text-[#414141] text-sm mb-[20px]">The following scenario will sound more than familiar to you, because you've probably lived through it at one time or another: Your electronic devices have reached the end of their lifespan and it's time to buy new ones. What do you do with your old e-waste? Most of the time, people tend to just throw their old electronics in the trash. This is of course wrong, because you have to dispose of electronic waste properly! You can't just throw it in the landfill for the following reason: </p>
     <h2 className="text-[#333333] font-bold text-2xl mb-[10px]">Dispose of e-waste correctly - the effects on the environment</h2>
     <p className="text-[#414141] text-sm mb-[20px]">Here's the hard truth: When electronics end up in landfills, both plastics and metals break down in an environmentally unfriendly way. This applies to the water, the earth, the plants and the animals around you. Properly disposing of e-waste is therefore incredibly important. Let's take a closer look at the negative effects of incorrect disposal.</p>

     <h2 className="text-[#333333] font-bold text-2xl mb-[10px]">Plastic impact</h2>
     <p className="text-[#414141] text-sm mb-[20px]">Plastic and plastic are a major environmental concern because they are not built like other materials. When these are broken down, they become microplastic particles. Unfortunately, these are harmful to plants, animals and fish. Because humans consume all of these food sources, it means they also consume microplastics. Microplastics have also been found in the digestive tract of fish, even fish eaten by humans. Exact effects on humans are still unclear, but everyone agrees: POSITIVE DEFINITELY NOT</p>
      
      <h2 className="text-[#333333] font-bold text-2xl mb-[10px]">Effects from metals</h2>
      <p className="text-[#414141] text-sm mb-[20px]">    Etcâ€¦

When these metals sit in landfills without being recycled, they oxidize and ionize in the soil (meaning they are affected by oxygen and break down). This is frightening because metals like lead, cadmium and mercury contain toxic chemicals that are released as they decompose. All of these metals are incredibly dangerous to human health. Not disposing of e-waste properly means treating the environment carelessly. The metals mentioned can seep into the soil and groundwater. Local groundwater can even become toxic if these chemicals are released into the soil in sufficient quantities. So how do we solve the dilemma of proper e-waste disposal? Here's the good news: the environmental impact can be mitigated if aprofessional disposal is guaranteed! The teams at AWL Zentrum clear out and dispose of waste safely, quickly and professionally. The best thing, however, is that disposing of electronic waste properly is our top priority!</p>
