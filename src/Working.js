            <p className='text-[#5C5C5C] font-semibold text-base text-center mx-auto mb-[20px] max-w-3xl'>When clearing out, make an appointment with our team to clear out your apartment or  house  . We calculate in such a way that the order can be processed in one day. Therefore, in consultation with you, they also start relatively early in the day, usually between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. Later starting times are of course possible by arrangement. We are completely guided by your information. A personal presence on site is not always necessary if you can organize access to the property in another way. </p>  
            <p className='text-[#5C5C5C] font-semibold text-base text-center mx-auto mb-[20px] max-w-3xl'>In recent years in particular, clearing orders have increased where the client lives far away. Direct consultation is the key to success here. As soon as we have cleared out the property according to your specifications, we ensure a clean handover. Of course, we take your specifications into account here, for example if certain pieces of furniture are to remain in the apartment. We also take care of small repair work, such as pulling nails out of the wall or unscrewing lamps - if you wish. Our goal is to offer you an all-round carefree package at a fixed price.</p>

            <p className='text-[#5C5C5C] font-semibold text-base text-center mx-auto mb-[20px] max-w-3xl'>There are a variety of reasons why you need to declutter. Sometimes there is a desire to create more space or to get rid of things that seem like baggage. Clearing out can be carried out for individual rooms or for entire apartments or entire houses. </p>  
            <p className='text-[#5C5C5C] font-semibold text-base text-center mx-auto mb-[20px] max-w-3xl'>The need to hire a clearing company often arises out of compulsion. A relative has died and the apartment has to be returned to a landlord or an inherited house is to be sold or prepared for a subsequent user. Moving for professional or personal reasons can also make it necessary to clear out an apartment, often under time pressure.</p>
